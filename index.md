## **Professional Self-Assessment**

<p style="text-indent: 55px;">
My journey through the Computer Science program has been full of growth, persistence, and the ability to apply theory to real-world problems. As a Navy veteran and now a Cloud Technician, I have consistently pursued opportunities to strengthen my technical foundation while balancing family, work, and school. This ePortfolio represents both my technical enhancements across software engineering, algorithms, and databases, as well as my professional development toward a career in Cybersecurity and Cloud.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 55px;">
Over the course of the program, I expanded my skills from application development into areas of system administration, cloud infrastructure, and security. I grew into roles where collaboration, communication, and leadership were essential, whether training my Navy division, troubleshooting in MSP environments, or guiding users through technical issues. This ePortfolio showcases enhanced artifacts that demonstrate my technical growth and my professional strengths in communication, collaboration, and problem-solving.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 55px;">
Data structures and algorithms provided me with the tools to approach problem solving with efficiency. I applied these concepts directly in enhancements such as building a Binary Search Tree to optimize searches within my weight tracking app. Software engineering principles were reinforced by my refactor of the same application into an MVVM architecture, supported by testing and CI/CD. In database management, I integrated MongoDB with Flask and Dash to create a secure, data-driven analytics platform. Across each of these projects, I incorporated a security mindset by validating inputs, applying least-privilege principles, and protecting sensitive data.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 55px;">
My goal is to continue growing as a Cybersecurity and Cloud professional. This program, and the portfolio it produced, highlights not only my technical skills but also the qualities employers seek: adaptability, discipline, teamwork, and the drive to continually learn and improve.

## **Course Outcomes**
### Throughout my ePortfolio and narratives, I demonstrate the following outcomes:

- I employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science.  
- I design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.  
- I design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.  
- I demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.  
- I develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.

## **Informal Code Review**
### Overview:

<p style="text-indent: 55px;">
My code review video walks through each of my three artifacts, highlighting existing functionality, areas for improvement, and planned enhancements. I demonstrate professional-quality communication while analyzing structure, efficiency, testing, and security. The review covers my Android Weight Tracker App (software design and engineering), the Binary Search Tree enhancement (algorithms and data structures), and the MongoDB + Flask project (databases).
</p>

- **Existing functionality:** Overview of features and limitations in each original artifact.  
- **Code analysis:** Structure, efficiency, maintainability, and security concerns.  
- **Enhancements:** Planned refactor to MVVM, optimized BST, and secure database integration.

## **Artifact 1 — Software Design & Engineering**
### Android Weight Tracking App (MVVM Refactor)

<p style="text-indent: 55px;">
Originally created in CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming, this app allowed users to log and track daily weight entries using SQLite. For enhancement, I refactored the code into an MVVM architecture, implemented Room with DAO for data persistence, and added JUnit and Espresso tests. Security enhancements included input validation and least-privilege database access.

## **Artifact 2 — Algorithms and Data Structures**
### Binary Search Tree for Weight Entries

<p style="text-indent: 55px;">
For my second enhancement, I applied algorithmic principles by implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) to handle weight entries more efficiently. This allowed searches by date to operate in O(log n) time rather than O(n). I developed unit tests to verify correctness.

## **Artifact 3 — Databases**
### MongoDB CRUD + Flask REST API 

<p style="text-indent: 55px;">
My third enhancement focused on database integration and security. Building on a CRUD module developed for animal shelter data, I created a Flask REST API with authentication and parameterized queries. I also applied database indexing and query analysis using PyMongo.
